# etch-a-sketch-project

This is a project for the Odin Project course (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

The program asks the user for a number between 1 and 50 and then creates a grid with equal number of even rows and columns. Each element in the grid will change to a black background color on mouse over. There is also a reset button to create a new grid
